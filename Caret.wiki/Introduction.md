Welcome to the Caret documentation! This guide is a work in progress. If you find any problems, please file issues with the repo and let me know.

Caret is a text editor for Chrome and Chrome OS. It's a packaged app, meaning that everything is written in web technology: JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Despite this, it manages to be useful and powerful, emulating many of the best features of Sublime Text. In fact, Caret has been almost entirely developed in itself, on Chrome OS, since its initial release.
